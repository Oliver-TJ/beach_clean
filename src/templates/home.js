                We‚Äôre thrilled to share that our recent beach clean-up was a massive success!
                Together, 24 incredible volunteers removed <b>57.5kg of litter</b> from our beautiful coastline,
                stretching from Cullercoats to King Edwards Bay. <i>From plastic waste to dumped wiring,
                every piece collected helps protect marine life and keep our beaches pristine.</i>

                                It all began with a simple yet powerful idea: to protect the stunning
                                coastline of Tyne and Wear while creating pristine, enjoyable beaches
                                for both wildlife and people.
